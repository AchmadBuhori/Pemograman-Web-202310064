    <h1>The 10 Most Popular Programming Languages toLearn in 2022</h1>
    <p>There’s no question that software programming is a hot career right now. The <font color="red">U.S. Bureau of <br>
        Labor Statistics</font> projects 21 percent growth for programming jobs from 2018 to 2028, which is<br>
        more than four times the average for all occupations. What’s more, the median annual pay for a<br>
        software programmer is about $106,000, which nearly three times the median pay for all U.S.<br>
        workers.<br>
        Not all programming jobs are the same, however. Different roles, companies, and types of <br>
        software require knowing and understanding different programming languages—and it’s often <br>
        beneficial to know multiple languages. Trying to break into the field of software programming <br>
        can be a daunting experience, especially for professionals with no prior programming<br>
        experience.<br>
        The <font color=blue><u>Master of Science in Computer Science Align program</u></font> at Northeastern University is<br>
        specifically designed for students who want to transition into computer science from another<br>
        field of study.<br>
        <i>“Our aim is to transport students from a variety of different backgrounds and have them come<br>
        out as software engineers,” says Ian Gorton, PhD and director of the graduate computer<br>
        science programs at Northeastern University—Seattle. “We focus on math, programming, and<br>
        a variety of computer science and engineering concepts.”</i><br>
        Whether you’re new to programming or looking to brush up on your skills, it helps to know<br>
        which languages are in high demand. Here are 10 of the most popular programming languages<br>
        of 2020 based on the number of job postings listed on job search site Indeed, the average<br>
        annual salary for those jobs, and factors such as ease of use and potential for growth.<br>
